# **Task - 1**
>**Step 1: Understanding the Verilog Code**
In this step 1 we'll understand and implement the basic `RGB LED control system` and we learn its functionality and work flow of RGB driver.  
Where we will have internal oscillator and counter logic which Manages LED output states and provides a test signal for monitoring internal operations.  
You can view the [code implementation](Task_1_Files/Code_implementation.md) (review module declaration) and its [documentation](Task_1_Files/Understanding the Verilog Code.md) (Purpose,analyse,description,etc) of further information.  
>**Step 2: Creating the PCF File**
In this step 2 we'll Creating the PCF File for the led control system where we'll discuss about the Pin Mapping Configuration and its Design specific  
You can view the [documentaion](Task_1_Files/Creating_the_PCF_file.md) (Pin mapping,Pin assignments,etc) for further information.  
>**Step 3: Integrating with the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board**
In this step we'll review the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board datasheet to understand its features and pinout and do the connection to the board to the computer as described in the datasheet.  
You can view the [documentaion](Task_1_Files/Integrating VSD squadron FPGA mini.md) (Requirements,procedure,etc) for further information.  
>**Step 3: Final Documentation**
In this step I have documented Compile all observations, explanations, and steps into a comprehensive report.  
You can view the [documentaion](Task_1_Files/Final Documentation Report.md) (Pin mapping,integration steps,etc) for further information.
